Completed a data cleaning project in SQL based on an online tutorial. Focused on standardizing data in the 'NashvilleHousing' table. Utilized various SQL commands including standardizing date formats with CAST, populating missing address data using JOINs and ISNULL, splitting address data with SUBSTRING and CHARINDEX, ensuring consistency with a CASE statement, identifying and handling duplicates with a window function, and deleting unused columns with ALTER TABLE. Gained practical experience and familiarity with SQL commands for data cleaning and standardization tasks.
